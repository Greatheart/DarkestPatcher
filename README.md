# DarkestPatcher
Instruction:
1. Download file.
2. Run the installer ("DarkestPatcher.application"). (Sucks but I can't work out how to get it standalone!)
3. Run the "DarkestPatcher.application" file again.
4. Click "Find Game Dir", navigate to your game directory and click "Open". (Note: Do not click on any files. Due to limitations within WPF programming I had to use a hacky way of selecting folders.)
5. Click "Find Mod", navigate to your mod folder (ensure it is un-zipped) and click "Open". (Again, do not select any files.)
6. Click "Patch".
7. Any written lines should be displayed in the textbox on the left hand side.
